# Toodle Do

This responsive Todo webapp is created using Django framework.

It is a simple Todo list app, which keeps track of all the Tasks.

It's UI is inspired by the modern **Glassmorphism Design** which
is a minimalistic semi-transparent design which uses the **backdrop-filter property**
to obtain the glassy design.
